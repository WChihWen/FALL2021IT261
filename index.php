            <p>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Chih Wen Wang, and I come from Taiwan. When I was a university student in Taiwan, I studied information technology and management. However, I focused on learning how to build software and let it work on a computer or the Internet. While graduating, I became a programmer at a technology company in my country and worked for almost ten years. 
            </p>
            <p>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;However, my life was changed because I came to the United States with my wife. I have two goals now. One is that I have to improve my English ability. So, I go to study the ESL Program here. Another goal is that I yearn to earn an IT Program degree or certificate in the United States because I do not have any degree in the United States. In addition, I believe that I can learn more things from you guys.
